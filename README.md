- ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! And welcome to my repos.

My name is Nicolas Vila, I'm a DevOps engineer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I've been using computers since I was 7 years old, and Linux since '95 (last millenium!)
I started my career as a networker (Cisco, Juniper, you name it) and then kept learning more
and more and today, I know quite some stuff =)

- If you wish to contact me, you can drop me a line at valathar@gmail.com

Cheers!
